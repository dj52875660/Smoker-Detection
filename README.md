# Smoker Detection

## **Introduction**
This project introduces a deep learning-based image classification model for automatic smoker detection.
The dataset contains 1120 images evenly split between smokers and non-smokers, with careful curation to include 
similar gestures in both classes, such as people drinking water or using an inhaler. The model was trained on 80% 
of the dataset and tested on 20%, achieving an accuracy of 96%, making it a promising solution for environmental 
monitoring and surveillance in smart cities.

## **Background**
Cigarette smoking is a significant contributor to various health problems and environmental issues, 
making it a critical target for automated detection and screening in smart city environments. 
With advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning, image-based detection systems have gained 
prominence in efforts to monitor and control harmful behaviors like smoking. These systems play an essential
role in promoting a healthier environment by enabling real-time surveillance and early intervention in public spaces. 
Developing robust models capable of distinguishing between smokers and non-smokers is a step toward supporting these initiatives.
